- lua: add support for spank_option_getopt (spank:getopt)

Version 0.21 (2011-12-19):
- use-env: Do not fail on missing HOME environment variable.

Version 0.20 (2011-12-19):
- lua: Fix erroneous failures in spank_init().

- auto-affinity: Fix --auto-affinity=off
- use-env: Fix segfault in remote options processing
- lua: Do not fail on error loading/compiling lua scripts by default
   (Set 'failonerror' for old behavior. see spank-lua(8) man page)

Version 0.18 (2011-10-11):
- Disable build of cpuset plugin on CHAOS5 systems (LLNL-only).
- lua: Add S_STEP_ALLOC_MEM and S_STEP_ALLOC_CORES for spank:get_item()
- lua: Add multi-value return for S_TASK_EXIT_CODE (status, code, signal, core)

Version 0.17 (2011-03-22):
- Disable build of oom-detect plugin, which is now obsolete (LLNL-only).
- Fix cpuset plugin build against slurm-2.3.

Version 0.16 (2011-01-12):
- Lua: Package a lua 'schedutils' module for access to sched_getaffinity(2)
   and sched_setaffinity(2) from lua spank plugins.

Version 0.15 (2011-01-10):
- auto-affinity: Fix bug in auto CPU affinity enable for case where
   multiples_only is not set.
- Allow a repeat count for CPU masks in the masks= option. For example,
   0xf0*4,0x0f*2 = 0xf0,0xf0,0xf0,0xf0,0x0f,0x0f.

Version 0.14 (2010-10-28):
 - auto-affinity: Check for SLURM's -c, --cpus-per-task, and if set
    to a value greater than 1, use this for cpt,cpus_per_task.
 - auto-affinity: Unless the config option 'multiples_only' is set
    round cpus_per_task down to the next multiple, if the result is
    greater than 1. (E.g. 5 tasks on a 12 CPU node would use
    2 CPUs per task, leaving 2 CPUs unbound.)

Version 0.13 (2010-08-19):

   mapping of tasks to CPUs.

 - Added lua plugin.
 - Fix preprocessor tests for SLURM-2.1.0

Version 0.8 (2009-11-05):
 - Added setsched plugin (Mattheiu Hautreux)
 - Adapt existing plugins to new API in SLURM-2.1.0.

 - Added statfs(1) after mount in private-mount plugin.

Version 0.6 (2009-04-23):
 - Added private-mount plugin (llnl subpackage).

Version 0.5 (2009-03-13):
 - auto-affinity: Don't assume any correspondence between CPU
    logical ID and CPU physical location (i.e. socket). This fixes
    poor CPU assignment on systems where CPUs are not necessarily
    sequentially numbered.
 - The preserve-env plugin is no longer packaged automatically
    with the slurm-spank-plugins RPM. This functionality is now
    available in SLURM directly as of SLURM 1.4.
 - Don't include oom-detect in the base slurm-spank-plugins RPM,
    it belongs in the llnl-specific RPM only.
   
Version 0.4 (2008-10-09):
 - preserve-env: Fix slurmstepd crash when dealing with environment
    variables larger than 64B (a very common case). The plugin now
    uses dynamic instead of static buffers.
